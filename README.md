# Text Editor Code

This is my text editor code follwoing the starter code provided.
The task, was to create a text editor that can open in a browser window. It will be a single page application and feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser.

# The application was deployed in Heroku to test
